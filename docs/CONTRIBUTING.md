# Contributing to the Salesforce Code Review Field Guide

Contributions are welcome. If you find an error or want to add a new lens, open an issue or submit a PR.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch for your change.
3. Make the change. Keep prose short and concrete.
4. Verify your change renders cleanly: `mkdocs build`.
5. Submit a pull request with a brief description.

## Conventions

- Every lens chapter ends with a `## What to Check` quick-reference section.
- No em dashes (`--`) or en dashes (`--`) in authored prose.
- Use placeholders: `<ClassName>`, `<SObject>`, `<triggerName>`.
- Findings must be specific: name the class, method, and line where possible.
- Severity labels (Critical, High, Medium, Low) are used consistently throughout.
- State what NOT to do alongside what to do.
